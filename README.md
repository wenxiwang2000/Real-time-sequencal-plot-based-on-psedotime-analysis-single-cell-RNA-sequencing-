# Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline (Scanpy + Optional Streamlit Interface)

This repository provides a reproducible, parameter-driven single-cell RNA-seq workflow for Cell Ranger `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` outputs. The pipeline is implemented in Python using Scanpy and includes an optional Streamlit interface that serves **only** as a clean parameter input and results preview layer. All computational analysis runs in the backend Python pipeline to ensure reproducibility, stability, and independence from UI state.

The core workflow follows a standard and transparent single-cell analysis structure: loading 10x matrices, computing quality control metrics (gene counts, UMI counts, mitochondrial percentage), filtering cells and genes using configurable thresholds, normalization and log-transformation, highly variable gene selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA), neighborhood graph construction, Leiden clustering, UMAP visualization, and cluster-specific marker gene identification exported to Excel. The design supports both single-sample and multi-sample or multi-stage datasets, with optional batch integration using Harmony.

This framework is optimized for resolving complex tissue compositions and identifying distinct cellular populations across developmental stages or experimental conditions. Users can iteratively refine clustering resolution and biological signal by adjusting a focused set of high-impact parameters, including QC thresholds, number of highly variable genes (`n_hvg`), number of principal components (`n_pcs`), neighborhood size (`n_neighbors`), and Leiden clustering resolution.

All results are saved as `.h5ad` objects for downstream analysis, along with QC plots, UMAP embeddings, and marker tables, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. By combining a code-first analytical backbone with a minimal, aesthetically clean interface for parameter entry, this pipeline balances robustness, flexibility, and ease of use while minimizing software-driven artifacts and workflow instability.
